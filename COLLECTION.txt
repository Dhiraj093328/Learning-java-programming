COLLECTION

Collection is a group of elements.


WHY DO WE NEED COLLECTION?
- Array is a collection of elements of similar data types.
- Array has a fixed size.
- Once the array size is defined, it cannot grow or shrink.

To overcome this limitation, Collections are used.


ARRAYLIST
- ArrayList is a collection of elements of the same type.
- It can grow and shrink dynamically when elements are added or removed.


COLLECTION IN JAVA
- Collection can grow and shrink dynamically.
- Size changes based on actions like adding or removing elements.


ITERABLE INTERFACE
- Iterable is the root interface in the Collection Framework.


MAIN TYPES OF COLLECTION INTERFACES IN JAVA

1. LIST
- List is a sequence of elements.
- It maintains insertion order.
- It allows duplicate elements.

Classes that implement List:
1. ArrayList
2. LinkedList
3. Vector
4. Stack


2. SET
- Set is a collection of well-defined elements.
- It does not allow duplicate values.
- It stores only unique elements.

Classes that implement Set:
1. HashSet
2. LinkedHashSet
3. SortedSet (TreeSet)


3. TREE
- Tree is used to arrange data in a specific order.
- Example: Ascending order.


4. QUEUE
- Queue follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

Classes that implement Queue:
1. PriorityQueue
2. ArrayDeque
