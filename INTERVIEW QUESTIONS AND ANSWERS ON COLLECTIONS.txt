INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON COLLECTIONS


1. WHAT IS COLLECTION?
Collection is a framework in Java used to store, manage,
and manipulate a group of objects as a single unit.
It provides dynamic storage and flexibility compared to arrays.


2. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GENERICS AND COLLECTION?

---------------------------------------------------------
| GENERICS                    | COLLECTION              |
---------------------------------------------------------
| Provides type safety         | Stores group of objects |
| Restricts data type          | Manages data            |
| Avoids ClassCastException   | Allows dynamic storage  |
| Works at compile time       | Works at runtime        |
| Example: ArrayList<String>  | Example: ArrayList      |
---------------------------------------------------------


3. WHY DO WE NEED COLLECTIONS?
- Arrays have fixed size.
- Collections grow and shrink dynamically.
- They provide built-in methods for searching, sorting,
  and manipulating data.
- Collections improve code flexibility and performance.


4. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARRAY AND COLLECTION?

---------------------------------------------------------
| ARRAY                       | COLLECTION              |
---------------------------------------------------------
| Fixed size                  | Dynamic size            |
| Stores primitive & objects  | Stores only objects     |
| No built-in utility methods | Rich utility methods    |
| Less flexible               | More flexible           |
---------------------------------------------------------

5.WHAT ARE THE THREE COLLECTION INTERFACES USED IN JAVA?

The three main collection interfaces used in Java are:

1. LIST INTERFACE
- Stores elements in a sequence.
- Maintains insertion order.
- Allows duplicate elements.
Examples:
- ArrayList
- LinkedList
- Vector
- Stack


2. SET INTERFACE
- Stores only unique elements.
- Does not allow duplicate values.
- Does not maintain insertion order (except LinkedHashSet).
Examples:
- HashSet
- LinkedHashSet
- TreeSet


3. QUEUE INTERFACE
- Stores elements in FIFO (First In First Out) order.
- Used when elements need to be processed in order.
Examples:
- PriorityQueue
- ArrayDeque
