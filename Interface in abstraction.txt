Interface :
-Interface contains static constants and abstract method which is use to achieve 100% abstraction in java program
- All methods are by default abstract till java 8
- interface is used to achieve multiple inheritance and hybrid inheritance in java
 
ex :
interface A{

	void show();

	void run();

	void draw();


}

java 8 : it allows us to write static and default method
java 9 : it allows us to write private methods
